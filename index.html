        <p> I am a Shiba Inu which means someday I’m gonna grow up to a trickster. Did you know, shibas are one of the oldest dog breeds, and we are genetically the closest related to wolves out of all dog breeds?</p>

        <p>Shiba Inus are one of the hardest dogs to train because we are very proud (for good reasons, we are the best!) As one wise Shiba said, “I am Shiba. Seppuku is not enough.”</p>

        <p>Right now, my best friend is my older brother, Dexter. He’s not a Shiba Inu like me, but I still like him. When he’s excited, he likes to spin around in cirles and roll on the ground (he’s so silly).</p>

        <p> Shiba Inus are a very popular breed thanks to internet-famous Shibas like Doge and others. Maybe someday I’ll be famous too!</p>
